  , "s | static  - Static mode does not monitor new clipboard activity, however you can set the current clipboard item"
  , "q | queue   - Queue mode treats your stored clipboard as a queue, you will only paste from the top, and only cut or copy items to the bottom. When you paste, the topmost item will be removed and your clipboard selection will be moved to the next item"
  , "a | advance - Advance Mode does not remove selections, but is similar to Queue mode in that when you paste, your selection will advance automatically"
  , "the filename argument is used to choose an alternative filepath to use for the queue.  the default is ~/queue.txt, you can customize your own queue file,  use newlines to seperate the content,  for multiline clips, you can use the omega (Î©) character"

  , "Up/Down Arrow keys - change selection, setting the current clipboard item"
