1. currently does not support multi-line clips, build a special delimiter system?

2. currently the two processes need to be run seperately, combine them with haskell

3. publish a haskell wrapper/port for the node library?

4. general logging cleanup?

5. wrap up with a brick-based UI? (reads file once every 500ms and renders to the screen)

6. take a optional argument with a path to a queue file already made (preloaded forms), if this is used, the real queue should be a copy

7. refactor JS stack to purescript

8. does it look in current folder or does it always use the project folder queue.txt file?
